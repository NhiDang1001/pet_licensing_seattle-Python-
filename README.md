### Background
Hi! I'm Nhi Dang. I've grown a love for data analytics over the years. I took several data related coursework such as Data Science Statistics, Big Data Analytics, Probability & Discrete Mathematics at the University of Washington - Seattle, one of the top-ranked universities globally. I spend most of my freetime on learning Data Analytics and working on my own projects. The project I'm most proud of is the Seattle Pet Licensing. As a pet lover, I love working with Pet dataset. I've been working over and over again with this Seattle Pet Licensing Dataset, using MySQL, R (ggplot2), and Python(matplotlib). 

Now I focus on analysing whatever datasets come my way, automating my life wherer I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
